Improving the chunking system can significantly enhance the user experience and the accuracy of your document retrieval system. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to refine the chunking approach:

1. **Semantically Meaningful Chunks**:
   - Instead of chunking purely by character count, consider chunking by paragraphs. This way, each chunk will represent a coherent block of text, making it easier for users to understand the context.
     ```python
     chunks = raw_text.split('\n\n')  # Assuming paragraphs are separated by two newline characters.
     ```

2. **Sentence-Level Chunking for Finer Granularity**:
   - If you want to achieve finer granularity, you can consider chunking by sentences using Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools. This can be useful when documents have very long paragraphs.
     ```python
     from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize
     chunks = sent_tokenize(raw_text)
     ```

3. **Chunk Size Variability**:
   - Instead of a fixed size, allow some variability in chunk size based on semantic breaks in the content. For instance, if you have a maximum chunk size, don't break a paragraph or sentence in half just to fit that size. Instead, take the entire paragraph or sentence even if it slightly exceeds the set size.

4. **Chunk Metadata**:
   - Store metadata for each chunk. This can include the main topic or a brief summary. This helps in quickly identifying the main content of the chunk without having to scan the entire text. There are several automatic text summarization tools and libraries available that can assist with this.

5. **Handling Headers and Footers**:
   - Documents, especially PDFs, might have headers and footers (e.g., page numbers, document titles). Ensure your chunking system can identify and possibly exclude or handle them appropriately to avoid redundancy.

6. **Overlap Between Chunks**:
   - Depending on your use case, you might consider having some overlap between chunks. This ensures that if a user's query matches a portion at the end of one chunk and the beginning of another, the relevant content isn't missed.
   - However, be careful with overlaps as they can lead to redundant content in the search results.

7. **Chunk Identifier**:
   - Along with the chunked text, store a unique identifier for each chunk, which can be a combination of the document name and the chunk's starting position. This will be helpful during retrieval and when providing context to the user.

8. **Context Preservation**:
   - Store a few sentences or lines before and after each chunk (without using them in the similarity search). This way, when presenting a chunk to the user, you can show a bit of the surrounding context, making it easier for them to understand the chunk's content.

9. **Chunk Filtering**:
   - Once you've chunked the document, consider filtering out chunks that are too short or lack meaningful content (e.g., a chunk that only contains an image caption or a page number).

10. **Testing and Feedback**:
   - After implementing the new chunking system, it's crucial to test its effectiveness. If possible, gather feedback from users or colleagues on the relevance and coherency of the retrieved chunks.

Remember, the goal of chunking is not just to break down large documents into smaller pieces, but to do so in a way that preserves meaning and context. The ideal chunking system is one that aligns with the user's information needs and the nature of the documents in your dataset.
